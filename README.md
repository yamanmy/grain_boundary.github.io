Finding a grain boundary in images of perovskite thin films

Grainboundary is a package to analyze grain boundary in details directly from electron microscopy images!

To use it, just import the grainboundary package and upload your SEM image and you will get a grain boundary summary and interactive plots showing the size feautures of your particles.

This is a very handy tools for scientists working with perovskite thin films. Knowing the size distribution of the perovskite is crucial for solar cell applications.

Let's walk together through the step that will bring from your electron microscopy image to the size analysis of your perovskite thin films.
